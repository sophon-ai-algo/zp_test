Preface
=======
We prepared several demos to let you get familiar with Sophon-Inference more quickly.
They are a classification demo(resnet-50) and three detection demos(ssd, yolov3, mtcnn).
For each demo, we implemented different cases to adapt to multiple applications.


The difference among cases in a demo
____________________________________
Each case differed from others among the parameters below.

*ID:* the number of the case in this demo.

*Input:* input date type, image or video.

*Decoder:* libs for decoding the input. 
"opencv" is the public release version of opencv which using CPU for decoding.
"bm-opencv" and "ffmpeg" are the bitmain versions of opencv and ffmpeg which using VPU for decoding.

*Preprocessor:* libs for processing image or tensor.
"opencv" is the public release version of opencv which using CPU for caculating.
"bm-opencv" and "bmcv" are the bitmain versions for processing image or tensor.

*Data Type:* data type of the bmodel to be used, fp32 or int8.

*Model:* model name.

*Mode:* two modes, static mean input tensor shapes of bmodel are unchanged, 
while dynamic means input tensor shapes of bmodel can be changed.

*Model Number:* multiple models are supported at the same time.

*TPU Number:* multiple TPUs are supported at the same time.

*Multi Thread:*: multiple thread are supported at the same time.


Return Values
_____________
We also defined a return value list for each case, for reference.
