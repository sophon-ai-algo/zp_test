Sophon Inference Installation
_____________________________

For different application scenarios, BITMAIN provides PCIE and SOC based on the BM168x chip, which corresponds to two different running modes:

* PCIE mode: The SDK runs on the X86 platform, and the BM168x acts as a deep learning acceleration card for the PCIE interface.
* SOC mode: The SDK runs independently on the BM168x platform and supports connection to other devices via Gigabit Ethernet.


BMNNSDK supports the above two modes of operation and is fully compatible on the application interface.
Please download the corresponding BMNNSDK to install according to the product form and requirements.
It should be noted that in SOC mode, the BMCompiler module is not included in the BMNNSDK.
You can use BMCompiler to complete offline compilation of the model in PCIE mode (no need to install SC3 accelerator card).
The compiled bmodel can be loaded and run in SOC mode.

Currently SophonInference supports PCIE mode, and the SOC mode.
For SOC mode, Sophon Inference has already pre-installed on Sophon SE3.
Including SAIL(cpp) and SAIL/AutoRunner/Algokit(python3).
For PCIE mode, Sophon Inference has also provided SAIL(cpp) and SAIL(python3).


PCIE mode
^^^^^^^^^

**a).Requirements**

Operating System: Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian.

Software Environment: : BMNNSDK with PCIE mode installed.

**b).Installation**

    .. code-block:: shell
       
       # Install the python module of Sophon Inference.
       cd ${sophon_inference}/python3/x86
       pip3 install sophon_x86-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl --user

SOC mode
